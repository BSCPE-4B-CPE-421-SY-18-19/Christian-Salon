> Why is it working?
  * The Raspeberry Pi is working because it has an OS. The Raspberry Pi will not boot if it does not contain
    any OS.
  * The indicator for the Raspberry Pi to be functional is its Red (POWER) and Green (ACTIVE) LED.
  * If the Red LED is not blinking, it means the supply meets the requirements to the Raspberry Pi.
  * If the green LED is not blinking, it means there is something wrong with your OS, or your SD card is
    corrupted.
